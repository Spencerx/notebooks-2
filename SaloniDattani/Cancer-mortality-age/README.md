This contains a script to generate three charts to show how cancer mortality varies with age:

1. Death rates from each cancer, by age
2. Relative share of cancer deaths from each cancer, by age
3. Number of deaths from each cancer, by age

The dataset I saved is from 2018 to 2022 and can be downloaded from the CDC Wonder database at: https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/saved/D158/D406F321

You can update the chart with new data from the CDC Wonder database here: https://wonder.cdc.gov/

Go to Underlying cause of death -> group by: single-year age group, ICD-10 113 Cause List
In section 6, click ICD-10 113 Cause list
Highlight #Malignant neoplasms until #In situ neoplasms
Download and save to data_folder

The output plot is also available in the folder.
