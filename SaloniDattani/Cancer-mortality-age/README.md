This contains a script to generate three charts to show how cancer mortality varies with age:

1. Death rates from each cancer, by age
2. Relative share of cancer deaths from each cancer, by age
3. Number of deaths from each cancer, by age

It uses period data from 2017â€“2020, from the US CDC Wonder database.

The data can be downloaded from the CDC Wonder database: https://wonder.cdc.gov/

Go to Underlying cause of death -> group by: single-year age group, ICD-10 113 Cause List
In section 6, click ICD-10 113 Cause list
Highlight #Malignant neoplasms until #In situ neoplasms
Download and save to data_folder

The dataset I saved is from 2018 to 2022 and can be accessed at: https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/saved/D158/D406F321

The output plot is also available in the folder.
