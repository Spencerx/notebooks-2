This folder contains a script to generate a plot of infant mortality over time, using data from the Office for National Statistics in the UK.

The script calculates the mortality rate per-day, from the intervals, and interpolates it across the year. This is then plotted with a line for each 10 years.

The output plot is also available in the folder.
