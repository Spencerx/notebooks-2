# README

This folder contains scripts to reproduce a chart on mortality rates from different causes of death, in France from 1925 to 1999.

- In the inputs folder, you can find the data and scripts used to create the chart.
- In the outputs folder, you can find the output chart in .svg format.

The script is adapted from the paper:
Visualizing compositional data on the Lexis surface. Jonas Schöley, Frans Willekens (2017). Data and code can be downloaded from: https://www.demographic-research.org/Volumes/Vol36/21/

While the original paper plotted the _percentage_ of deaths from each cause, this script plots the _mortality rate_ from each cause instead.

The underlying source of the data is the Institut National d'Études Démographiques.
