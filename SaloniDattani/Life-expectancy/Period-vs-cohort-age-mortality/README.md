This folder contains scripts to generate a plot of age-specific mortality, compared between period and cohort data.

The scripts are saved in either python or R, but they are equivalent.

The data comes from the Human Mortality Database: mortality.orghttps://www.mortality.org/

The output plot is also available in the folder.
