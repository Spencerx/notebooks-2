This folder contains R scripts or python scripts to recreate a chart that shows countries with the highest recorded life expectancy, and predictions of the limits of life expectancy.

The chart is based on Figure 1 in the paper: 

Oeppen, J., & Vaupel, J. W. (2002). Broken Limits to Life Expectancy. Science, 296(5570), 1029â€“1031. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1069675

The chart is extended for recent years. 

From 1950 onwards, we use the UN World Population Prospects' life expectancy estimates, which can be found here: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/female-and-male-life-expectancy-at-birth-in-years
