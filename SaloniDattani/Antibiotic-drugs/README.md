This folder contains a dataset and script to generate two timelines of antibiotic drug development.

The dataset is from Hutchings et al. (2019), please cite it as the reference for the dataset:

> Hutchings, M. I., Truman, A. W., & Wilkinson, B. (2019). Antibiotics: Past, present and future. Current Opinion in Microbiology, 51, 72â€“80. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2019.10.008

The folder contains two scripts:

1. The Golden Age of Antibiotics - which shows a timeline when each antibiotic drug class was first available for clinical use - under `antibiotic-drug-timeline.R`
2. Antibiotics: time from discovery to innovation - which shows a timeline of the time between discovery and availability for clinical use - under `antibiotic-drug-discovery-to-development.R`

The output plots are also included in the folder.
