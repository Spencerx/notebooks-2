This folder contains a dataset and script to generate two timelines of antibiotic drug development, using data from [Hutchings, Truman and Wilkinson (2019). Antibiotics: Past, present and future](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369527419300190).

The dataset is from Hutchings et al. (2019), please cite it as the reference for the dataset:

> Hutchings, M. I., Truman, A. W., & Wilkinson, B. (2019). Antibiotics: Past, present and future. Current Opinion in Microbiology, 51, 72â€“80. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2019.10.008

The folder contains two scripts:

1. The Golden Age of Antibiotics (which shows a timeline when each antibiotic drug class was first available for clinical use)
2. Antibiotics: time from discovery to innovation (which shows a timeline of the time between discovery and availability for clinical use)

The output plots are also included in the folder.
